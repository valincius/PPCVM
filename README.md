# PPCVM (a PowerPC virtual machine)

This project was created to better application security for PowerPC executables (specifically PS3 ELFs) and to demonstrate how the PPC processor works

## Upcoming features

Going to add functionality to load an executable itself rather than having to copy the code itself into the program
